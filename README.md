# DifficultyTweaker
**This mod is still in beta. There might be issues. Please report them in [the GitHub page](https://github.com/Pepe20129/difficultytweaker/issues).**

This is a mod that lets you customize Minecraft's difficulty by changing the vanilla features that change with difficulty. This is done through the `/difficultyTweaker` command. The command is inspired by the carpet mod's command, meaning that if parameters are not provided the command will tell you information like the current state of the option and the default state of it for individual options.
